This update is a full rewrite of this mod and now works by storing fluids separate from all blockstates.
Which solves starting time and memory usage.
In addition to that, it also comes with features that weren't really possible before.

### This update requires YetAnotherConfigLib

### New Features:
- Fluids don't need to be added to the config manually to use them for fluidlogging
- Many blocks that are non-waterloggable are now fluidloggable
- Fluids can now pass through blocks (Fluid Permeability)
- Almost everything is configurable and changes to the config will be immediately applied to your world

### Why beta?
This mod interacts with chunk saving/loading which is one of the main reasons.
There might also be some drastic changes to this mod's code.
